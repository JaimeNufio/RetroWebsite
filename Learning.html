			Wezla is a particularly indepth character designed for Klei Entertainment's game "Don't Starve". The character was a top-down design, with art assets and creative concepts by Jocelis Gutierrez. The character has unique dialouge, behavior, abilities, and items he can use to his advantage. Wezla represents a great learning experience in many areas of game development, such as: teamwork, version control, animation, and world generation, to name a few.

A top-down designed character based on Nikola Tesla. Wesla comes with full dialogue, custom art assets, original game items, and abilities that are unique amongst comparable character-mod projects. Wezla was a great learning experience in the area's of: Animation, Version Control, Game Design, Character Design, World Generation, and many other fields. Art assets and creative assistance from Jocelis Gutierrez.</div>

					> Glimmer and Family for DST
					</a></br><div class = "words">
A sort of spin-off of a character already in the game, Glommer, a bug companion. Glimmer is unique in that when paired with Glommer, they can breed children, a concept that is introduced by this mod. Glimmer was an "over the weekend" challenge to myself, but has since garnered over 40,000 unique downloads. </div>

					> The Gnome Staff
					</a></br><div class = "words">One of my earliest ventures in modding for this particular game. The objective of this mod was to introduce an item to the game that was similar to the "Wabajack" from Skyrim. The project essentially is a tool useable ingame to transform one prefab, into another, randomly.  </div>
